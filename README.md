# learning-to-be-a-wine-snob
Project to identify wine color and price based on information from the label

This repository contains a presentation and the associated R-code created for an undergraduate data science class. The PowerPoint gives an overview and interpretation of the analyses conducted in the code sample. The code can be run via the included a R markdown file - this markdown file has also been knit to an HTML webpage so other developers may view the formatted code alongside its outputs: https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/bwdickie/learning-to-be-a-wine-snob/blob/master/Wine%20Review%20Analysis.nb.html

The primary purpose of the models created in this project is interpretability, rather than complexity. Similarly, this presentation was created to be engaging for a group of undergraduate peers. I would encourage viewing the PowerPoint in presentation mode, as the animations are half the fun. 

Pour yourself a glass of whatever bottle you have on hand and enjoy learning how to use data to impress your wine-loving friends!

NOTE: The data for this analysis was originally sourced from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews
